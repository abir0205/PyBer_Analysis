# PyBer_Analysis

##Overview of the analysis
-The purpose of this analysis was to teach the student how to use Matplotlib and pandas to make different types of charts and graphs for visual analyses.
-Using these tools, the student was able to compare how ride data varies amongst urban, rural, and suburban cities.

##Results
-Urban cities have the largest number of riders (1625 riders), followed by suburban cities (625 riders), and lastly rural cities (125 riders).
-Conversely, urban cities have the lowest average fares ($24.53), followed by suburban cities ($30.97), and lastly rural cities ($24.53).

##Summary
-Urban cities having the largest number of riders makes sense as these areas tend to have more people. Consequently, it is natural they'd have the lowest average fare.
-To make things more equitable in rural areas, expanding access to rural areas may help
-Adding more lines in rural and suburban areas may allow more riders and therefore a decrease in price
-This can lead to a decrease in drivers and more use of PyBer
